Mid Course Assignment: Review

Description

Create a new project in tool of choice, LastnameFirstInitialmid for this assignment. 
You will need to define the following classes.

Develop a class called Rot13 that has a utility method called encrypt that takes a String as its parameter. 
The encrypt method encodes each character of the String parameter using the rot13 substitution cipher which 
simple "Rotates" each letter 13 places through the alphabet, wrapping around from Z back to A when necessary. 
Non-alphabetic characters are not altered.
Place Rot13 class in a package called edu.washington.midcourse.util
Next, create a Test class called Rot13Test and verify that encrypt method ofRot13 class does the requirements 
defined above using the following String: "Hello there. Testing, testing!" the validate return String is 
"Uryyb gurer. Grfgvat, grfgvat!"

Last step

write an application/class called Main and contains the method to allow running from the dos/shell commandline. 
The application takes one parameter which is a String. An example
java Main "Hello there. Testing, testing!"

But place the Main class in the following package called edu.washington.midcourse, which changes how you run 
java at the commandline from the example above.
Goto the dos/shell commandline and run Main. Pass in the following string that is used above, then capture the 
information and place into a file called console.txt in the project.
